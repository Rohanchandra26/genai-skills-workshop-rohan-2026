    "1. Create functions that perform specific tasks utilizing Google Gemini\n",

    "- **Function 1:** Classifies citizen questions into categories: `Employment`, `General Information`, `Emergency Services`, or `Tax Related`\n",
    "- **Function 2:** Generates social media posts for government announcements (weather emergencies, holidays, school closings, etc.)\n",
    "- **Unit Tests:** pytest-based tests for both functions\n",
    "- **Evaluation:** Google Vertex AI Evaluation Service API to assess and compare prompt strategies"
